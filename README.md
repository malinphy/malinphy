[Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/malinphy/Embedding_calls)
- [Named Entity Recognition](https://github.com/malinphy/named_entity_recognition)
  - Classification of named entities in a given sentence. System is designed with pre-trained BERT model.
- [Question Answer Matching by univesal sentence encoder](https://github.com/malinphy/quick_response_generator)
  - Tensorflow/Keras implementation of Question answer matching system. In short, this project is designed for finding the best possible answers for related         questions. 
- [Natural Language Inference Sentence embeddings](https://github.com/malinphy/natural_language_inference)
  - Detection of whether given sentence logically follows to next sentence. Sentences are vectorized using Universal Sentence Encoder(USE) and 
  system has been trained to optimize similarity of sentece vectors.
- [Sentiment Classification](https://github.com/malinphy/sentiment_classification)
  - Sentiment classification on twitter dataset. Deep neural network system on multi-class classification. 



[Recommender Systems](https://github.com/malinphy/recommender_sys)
Deep learning based modern recommendation systems has been worked. 
- [Two Stage Recommender System](https://github.com/malinphy/recommender_sys/tree/main/YouTube/anime_dataset/dataprocess)
  - Retrieval part to reduce the number of potential items   
  - Ranking part to provide a recommendation list of items for each user.
- [Convolutional Ranking based recommender system](https://github.com/malinphy/Caser_Model)
  - Personalized Sequential Recommender System
- [Neural Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/malinphy/neural_collaborative_filtering)
  - Neural network approach of matrix factorization
